			<h1>Email Data Point Retriever</h1>
			<p>
				This tool collects non-sensitive and non-private email thread data for research purposes.
				Email threads are groups of email messages that include an original message and all of its replies and forwards.
				<br><br>
				
				We are working to study how different people communicate via  email messages or forum posts and how we can predict
				when posts or messages will receive a response. In order to
				do so, we ask participants to share limited records of how they
				have communicated via email threads in the past and/or complete
				a short survey.
				Thank you for participating
			</p>
			<p>
				We will at most retrieve the data about from, to, cc, bcc, subjects, and attachments in your email messages, and how messages are sorted into threads.
				We will <b>NOT</b> collect the content of your messages.
				<br><br>
				If you choose not to share any recipient, subject, or attachment information with us (using the checkboxes below),
				we will only collect data in the following format, where we only collect anonymous IDs for recipients, messages, and threads.
				<textarea style="display:block; width:99%; height:100px; margin:auto">Message:1 Thread:1 From:[1] Recipients:[2] Date:Jan 10 13:03
Message:1 Thread:1 From:[3] Recipients:[2] Date:Jan 09 16:31
Message:2 Thread:2 From:[2] Recipients:[4,5] Date:Thu Jan 09 16:26
Message:3 Thread:2 From:[4] Recipients:[5,2] Date:Thu Jan 09 16:14
Message:4 Thread:3 From:[6] Recipients:[2] Date:Thu Jan 09 15:54
Message:5 Thread:4 From:[7] Recipients:[2] Date:Thu Jan 09 15:08</textarea>
				<br>
				If you share subjects, recipients, or attachements with us, we will associate email addresses, subjects, or attachments with those IDs.
				<br><br>
				After we retrieve your data, we will send you an email message.  In this message,
				we will provide a link to complete a short follow-up survey and review the data that we 
				collected. This review is so that you will be able to modify and confirm what is stored by the
				researchers to ensure does not contain any sensitive or private information.
				During the review of your data, you will be able to remove part or all of your data.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you would prefer to collect all data locally on your machine, and then choose what to send us at the end, we have a desktop app 
				<a href='EmailDataRetrieverGUI.jar'>here.</a>
