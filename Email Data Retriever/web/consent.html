				This study is part of a larger research project about access
				control, or how people control who has access to shared information.
				This study in particular works to understand how different people
				communicate via email messages or forum posts and how we can predict
				when posts or messages will receive a response. In order to
				do so, we ask participants to share limited records of how they
				have communicated via email in the past and/or complete
				a short survey.

		<strong>What are some general things you should know about research studies?</strong><br>
		<p>You are being asked to take part in a research study.  To join the study is voluntary. You may refuse to join, or you may withdraw your consent to be in the study, for any reason, without penalty.</p>
		<p>Research studies are designed to obtain new knowledge. This new information may help people in the future.   You may not receive any direct benefit from being in the research study. There also may be risks to being in research studies.</p>
		<p>Details about this study are discussed below.  It is important that you understand this information so that you can make an informed choice about being in this research study.</p>
		<p>You will be given a copy of this consent form.  You should ask the researchers named above any questions you have about this study at any time</p>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<strong>What is the purpose of this study?</strong><br>
		The purpose of this study is to determine how easy it is to use certain access control mechanisms to ensure secure collaboration. The data will be collected from up to 300 participants as they specify access control policies using various access control mechanisms. The data may include the access control needs of the participants and participant-specific information that can be used to semi-automatically meet these needs. To determine how well the access control needs of the subjects are met, we may log interactions of the participants and ask them to answer questions evaluating the mechanisms.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<strong>Are there any reasons you should not be in this study?</strong>
		You should not be in this study if you do not know how to use a computer.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<strong>How many people will take part in this study?</strong><br>
		This study will recruit up to 300 participants.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<strong>How long will your part in this study last?</strong><br>
		Your part in this study will consist of one or more sessions involving different kinds of sub tasks, with each session lasting no more than three hours. You may be contacted by electronic mail after each session to determine additional information. If you are contacted by electronic mail, it will be within two months of today. You will be allowed to volunteer for more than one session involving different tasks.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<strong>What will happen if you take part in the study?</strong><br>
		During a study session, you will be asked to complete one or more subtasks, involving one or more of the following steps: 
		<ul>
			<li>
			Access control experience, needs, and relevant data: We might determine your experience with setting access control in various environments such as a file system or social network. We might also determine from you how you would ideally like to exert the control in each of these systems. We might also determine data such as who your friends are in a social network that will allow our tools to semi-automatically meet these needs.</li>
			<li>
			Task training: The purpose of this step is to get you accustomed with the access control mechanisms and collaboration tools you will be using. 
			</li>
			<li>Complete the tasks: A task may involve no collaboration,
				collaboration with the computer/study-conductor, or collaboration
				with other participants. 
				<br><br>
				For example, you may be asked to
				individually create Facebook friend lists without conducting any
				collaboration task that needs these lists. In the Facebook case,
				rather than creating the friend lists from scratch, you may be asked
				to run an application that identifies your friends and their
				friends, and automatically proposes friend lists, which you then
				edit. 
				<br><br>
				Similarly, you may be asked to run an application that looks
				through various attributes of your past emails or makes predictions
				based on previous emails. It will compare its predictions with the
				actual recipients of the email without storing any information about
				the actual recipients, You will also be given a chance to use one or
				more recipient prediction user interface to compose actual emails
				and we will ask you to rate them.
				<br><br>
				In yet another example, you may be
				asked to selectively share information with other participants while
				also competing with them to win a game that reliably predicts how
				well basketball teams did in playoffs based on the records of these
				teams before playoffs. You may collaborate with each other to
				determine and specify the access control policies.
				<br><br>
				In general, you
				may be asked to complete the task alone, together with collocated
				users sharing a single computer, or with physically distributed
				users, each using a separate computer. The purpose of this step is
				to determine how easy-to-use certain access control mechanisms are
				to specify certain kinds of access control policies.
			</li>
			<li>
			Debriefing: After the tasks are completed or the time allotted to them is over, you will be asked to answer a questionnaire and volunteer any additional comments.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<strong>What are the possible benefits from being in this study?</strong><br>
		Research is designed to benefit society by gaining new knowledge. The benefits to you from being in this study may be your learning to use a technology that in the future may be implemented in commercial systems. </p>
		
		<p>
		<strong>What are the possible risks or discomforts involved from being in this study?</strong><br>
		There are no known risks.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<strong>How will your privacy be protected?</strong><br>
		To reduce privacy and confidentiality risks, the data collected in the study will not be associated with information that can be used to identify you. You will be assigned a code number, which will be the only link to your identity. You will not have any personally identifying information stored in the logs created as part of this study. All records will be stored electronically in a secure file system. Stored data will only have your code number and will not have any identifiers. The information that associates your name with a code number will only be stored on paper and will be stored separately from these records. All mappings between code numbers and names will be destroyed at the conclusion of the experiment. 
		<p>Note that even though we will collect participant emails as contact data, the emails will in no way be associated with any of the data we collect. Furthermore, upon study completion, as mentioned above, all contact information will be destroyed.</p>
		<p>Participants will not be identified in any report or publication about this study. Although every effort will be made to keep research records private, there may be times when federal or state law requires the disclosure of such records, including personal information. This is very unlikely, but if disclosure is ever required, UNC-Chapel Hill will take steps allowable by law to protect the privacy of personal information. In some cases, your information in this research study could be reviewed by representatives of the University, research sponsors, or government agencies for purposes such as quality control or safety.</p>
		<p>Check the line that best matches your choice:
			<ul>
			<li><input type="radio" name="recording" value="ok"> OK to record me during the study</li>
			<li><input type="radio" name="recording" value="notOk"> Not OK to record me during the study</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<strong>What if you want to stop before your part in the study is complete? </strong>
		<p>You can withdraw from this study at any time, without penalty.  The investigators also have the right to stop your participation at any time. This could be because you have failed to follow instructions, or because the entire study has been stopped.</p>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<strong>Will you receive anything for being in this study?</strong><br>
		You will receive up to $5 for participating in the study for each session, which will be paid when you start the session. Food and refreshments may be provided for you at the study site. You will not have to refund the money if you withdraw from the experiment at any time. If you do not arrive for the interview, you will not be paid.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<strong>Will it cost you anything to be in this study?</strong><br>
